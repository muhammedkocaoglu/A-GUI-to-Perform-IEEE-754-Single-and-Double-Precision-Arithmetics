# A-GUI-to-Perform-IEEE-754-Single-and-Double-Precision-Arithmetics

With this application, you can convert single or double precision Hexadecimal numbers in IEEE 754 format to decimal numbers. 
You can also perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations on them.
I plan to add more features the the application. If you have any idea and think would be useful, let me know.
I will try to add.
